User experience design blends my art and programming interests. My favorite mock up to date is one that showcases my dog's personal website and blog. Please view his site and other web design mocks here.

## Roman's Site

Inspired by my dog, Roman, this mock up using Adobe XD presents his personal site that includes his stats, clipped blog posts and favorite photos. Some features of note:

* I built his dog-head logo in Adobe Photoshop using the pen tool.
* The blurred photos on either side indicate a photo carousel in combination with the centered, shaded-circle indicator
* The Components Board displays the reusable components needed to build the site.

##Recipe Keeper

This mock up, also using Adobe XD, showcases a site where users can save family or personal recipes in digital form to reference when cooking or planning for events. Some features of note: 

* I created the home page category icons using various tools in Adobe Illustrator. 
* The right-side navigation menu icons were created in Adobe XD using the pen and shape tool.
