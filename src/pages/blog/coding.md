I started out as an admirer of the infinite possibilities of code and have worked my way forward with little web development projects to catch up. I am certain of the need to know programming in the future as technology continues its global conquest. I most like the elements of logic, design, and scalability. Please view a more complete portfolio on [GitHub](https://github.com/belladecocco). I have included my latest front end and back end ventures there. I have included some pictures and explanations below. 

## Authenticate

This project began as a collective effort with a friend to advance our programming skills. The theme of the application involves authenticating user identity. So far, I have added a sign-in and a register-user page using Angular 2. I am working on connecting these to the backend, which uses express and mongodb. 

## Job-Posting App

I began this project with a front end using Angular 1 with the intention of creating a job posting site. The outcome aside, I am proud of the code that went into the front end because it was some of my first ever. Ever. Since the planting of this seed, I have built off of it to learn other areas of programming: developing an api, building front end using Angular 2.

## Portfolio Site

This portfolio uses Netlify and Gatsby, giving me experience using react, markdown and SASS.
