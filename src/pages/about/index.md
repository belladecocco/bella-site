### Code
My programming skills developed late in the game. I started out as an admirer of the infinite possibilities of code and have worked my way forward with little web development projects to catch up. I am certain of the need to know programming in the future as technology continues its global conquest. I like most the elements of logic, design, and scalability . Please view my coding portfolio under the code tab. There, I have included descriptions and links to my latest front end and back end ventures. 

### Web Design
User experience design blends my coding and art interests. My favorite mock up to date is one that showcases my dog's personal website and blog. Please view his site and other design mocks under the web design tab.

### Writing
Little stories take my love of design to a new level: one of creating by what you cannot see. Much of my writing shines through with poetic taste and description. Penciling images with words became an additional mode of expressing myself. Please view my writing portfolio under the writing tab. There, I have included excerpts from an academic, philosophy essay and from my fiction novel-in-progress.  

 ### Art
My love to create started early with a simple pencil and paper. I never much liked color until recently in my transition to digital art and web design. Please view my art portfolio under the art tab. There, I have included some old pieces that are true to myself and some new pieces that integrate my matured technique.
