Here are a few of my art projects. My love to create started early with a simple pencil and paper. I never much liked color until recently in my transition to digital art and web design. For a look at my web designs please look under the web design tab.

## Elephants and Ivory Trade

This multimedia statement piece comments on the horrors of the ivory trade and elephant poaching through highlighted newspaper and article clippings as well as a mind-mapping of ivory trade associations and the contrast these associations make to elephant culture and elephants in popular media. The overlay of the mother and child in addition to the fond and popular elephant icons juxtaposes the inhumane consideration and treatment elephants receive.  The mother and child are painted in blue watercolor with the mind-mapping in red sharpie. Size: 36 x 54in.
